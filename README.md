# Restaurant Management App

This project is a web-based restaurant management system designed to streamline various aspects of restaurant operations, including table management, food ordering, employee management, and order processing.  The system aims to enhance the overall dining experience for customers and improve operational efficiency for restaurant owners and staff.
